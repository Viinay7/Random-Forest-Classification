**Random Forest Classification using Scikit-learn**
This repository demonstrates the use of the Random Forest algorithm for a classification problem in machine learning. The Random Forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning technique, builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions by taking a majority vote, making it highly robust and less prone to overfitting.

**In this tutorial, we will:**

Understand the basic working principle of the Random Forest algorithm.
Implement a digits classification problem using the RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn.
Provide an exercise to test your understanding.

**Theory Overview**
The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble method that relies on the concept of bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating). It operates as follows:

Decision Trees: At the core of Random Forests are Decision Trees. Each tree in the forest is built using a random subset of data and a random subset of features. This randomness introduces diversity in the trees.
Multiple Trees: The algorithm forms multiple decision trees, where each tree is trained independently.
Majority Voting: For classification, the Random Forest takes the majority vote of all trees to make the final prediction. For regression problems, it calculates the average prediction of all trees.
**Advantages:**
Reduces overfitting: By aggregating the results of several trees, Random Forest smooths out irregularities and noise, improving generalization.
Handles large datasets: Random Forest works well with large datasets and a high number of input variables.
Digits Classification Problem
We will solve a digits classification problem using Scikit-learnâ€™s RandomForestClassifier. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel images of hand-written digits, and the task is to classify them into 10 different categories (0-9).

The steps involved are:

Load the digits dataset.
Preprocess the data.
Train the Random Forest classifier.
Evaluate the model performance on a test set.
Display the classification results.
